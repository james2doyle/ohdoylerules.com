### Some Notes!!

Warning. This version is customized quite a bit. Including the plugins and the actual Markdown Parser.

Normally, Pico includes the PHP-Markdown lib. I have swapped it with the [PHP-Sundown C extension](https://github.com/chobie/php-sundown "chobie/php-sundown").

Why would I do this? Well PHP C extensions are crazy fast and are memory savvy. Sundown also has some extensions like fenced code blocks and [other niceness](https://github.com/chobie/php-sundown/blob/development/docs/ExtensionsAndRenderFlags.md "PHP-Sundown ExtensionsAndRenderFlags.md").
