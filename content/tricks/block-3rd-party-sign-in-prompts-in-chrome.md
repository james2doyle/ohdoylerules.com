If you have ever seen that annoying popup in Chrome?

{{ image(title="3rd party sign in prompts in chrome example", src="/images/2-block-3rd-party-sign-ins.png", style="max-width:80%;margin:0 auto") }}

These things suck right? Well you can block them:

{{ image(title="how to block 3rd party sign in prompts in chrome", src="/images/1-block-3rd-party-sign-ins.png", style="max-width:80%;margin:0 auto") }}

If you wanted to visit this setting directly, you can go to [chrome://settings/content/federatedIdentityApi](chrome://settings/content/federatedIdentityApi).

You can then set it to "block" these prompts so you never have to see them again!

There are some other settings in there for blocking specific sites or allowing them too.
