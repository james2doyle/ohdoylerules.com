I decided to host my old website because I wanted to show some work with Modernizr.

Looking back it is actually pretty cool! I kind of miss it haha. It seems to run much better than I remember. I think that is because it was the days of chrome 18 and Firefox 10 which had spotty 3d transform support.

Maybe someday I can make a sub-site or a project site based off of that design. This was also one of my first sites to use AJAX. It was pretty frustrating and hard at the time. It is funny looking at my code and the way I handled things back then. I read it and feel like I am looking at a strangers code.
