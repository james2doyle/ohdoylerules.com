I decided to host my old website because I wanted to show some work with
Modernizr.

Looking back it is actually pretty cool! I kind of miss it haha. It
seems to run much better than I remember. I think that is because it was
the days of chrome 18 and Firefox 10 which had spotty 3d transform
support.

Maybe someday I can make a sub-site or a project site based off of that
design. This was also one of my first sites to use AJAX. It was pretty
frustrating and hard at the time. It is funny looking at my code and the
way I handled things back then. I read it and feel like I am looking at
a strangers code.
