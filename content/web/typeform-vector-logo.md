Another difficult logo to find. This one is for the fun new Typeform service. Typeform allows you to create dynamic and fun forms for clients, events, and other general uses.

<div class="center">
  <a href="https://ohdoylerules.com/images/typeform.svg" title="typeform svg vector" target="_blank"><img alt="typeform svg vector" src="https://ohdoylerules.com/images/typeform.svg" ></a>
</div>

If you are a photoshopper, you can also <a href="https://ohdoylerules.com/images/typeform.eps" title="typeform eps vector" target="_blank">grab the EPS file</a>.
