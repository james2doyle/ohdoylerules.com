I somehow managed to find my way into an [AngularJS hangout](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cljavmi7kpup1fso43k3fkpk2eg "AngularJS Promises").

The hangout is about promises and deffereds. On the google plus [event page](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cljavmi7kpup1fso43k3fkpk2eg "Angularjs Promises Event Page"), there are links to all the plunkrs in the video. Here is the direct [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLaYaaq2Miw "Angularjs Promises Youtube").
