I recently switched to using Amazon Web Services for my hosting. It is awesome. Because it(EC2) is just a cloud computer, I can install anything I want and set up any workflow I desire.

I recently found [an article](http://goo.gl/0L3E6 "A web-focused Git workflow") that was about a website git workflow. I finally got the flow down, but it was taking a little too long to start a project. So I decided to [make it into a script](https://github.com/james2doyle/git-website-workflow "git-website-workflow bash script").

This works with any cloud computer workflow. It doesn't have to be just Amazon.

With a little help from [some people on google+](https://plus.google.com/109231487156400680487/posts/WzueZxHuP7b "google plus bash community post") I finally got it down.

Check out the [original article](http://goo.gl/0L3E6 "A web-focused Git workflow") on how it works and the philosophy of why.
