I have been trying to find the CSS3 badge in a SVG format but it wasnâ€™t that easy. The HTML5 one was the first result on Google. Now finally I found one. I am posting it here because now I will never lose it!

<div class="center">
  <img src="/images/html5css3badges.png" alt="HTML5 and CSS3 badges">
</div>

Here is the CSS3 logo:

<div class="center">
  <a href="/images/css3.svg" target="_blank" title="Download CSS3.svg"><img src="/images/css3.svg" alt="CSS3 Scalable vector graphic"></a>
</div>

Here is the HTML5 logo in-case you need it:

<div class="center">
  <a href="/images/html5.svg" target="_blank" title="Download HTML5.svg"><img src="/images/html5.svg" alt="HTML5 Scalable vector graphic"></a>
</div>

I found the logos on [this website](http://www.bobbyberberyan.com/2012/03/html-5-css-3-logos/ "bobby berberyan - html-5-css-3-logos"). They were in one single SVG file and I split them up.
