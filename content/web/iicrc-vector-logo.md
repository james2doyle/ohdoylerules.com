Another lost logo, this one is for the IICRC (institute of inspection cleaning and restoration). They are an international cleaning certification institure. Clearly. Here is their vector logo.

<div class="center">
  <a href="/images/iicrc.svg" title="iicrc svg vector" target="_blank"><img alt="iicrc svg vector" src="/images/iicrc.svg" ></a>
</div>

Enjoy. This was a huge pain to get right.
