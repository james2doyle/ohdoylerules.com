I wrote a post on WARPAINT Media about people who ask about getting a website for $100. It isn't an angry rant, although there is some frustration. It is more about courtesy.

I wouldn't ask you to take $100 for an entire weeks worth of work. So please, don't ask me. [Here is the article](http://warpaintmedia.ca/blog/2013/07/the-100-dollar-website "The $100 Website").
