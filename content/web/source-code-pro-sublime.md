I recently switched my font in sublime text to the new Adobe font, [Source Code Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html "Adobe Blog - Source Code Pro").

It looks fantastic! It is so smooth and crisp. To switch to it as your main font, first download the font. Then add the line “font_face”: “Source Code Pro” in your Preferences->User Settings(keyboard shortcut command+comma to open the settings) and that’s it! Pretty fly.
