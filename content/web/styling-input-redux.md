A few weeks ago, or something like that, I made a post about [styling your labels to act as checkboxes/radios](http://ohdoylerules.com/web/radio-checkboxes/ "Styling radio and checkbox inputs"). I recently saw [a post on Dribbble by Mikael Eidenberg](http://dribbble.com/shots/693245-Untitled-iPhone-synth-app-waveforms "iPhone-synth-app-waveforms") which inspired me to make some nicely styled examples of that method in action.

<div class="center">
  <img src="http://ohdoylerules.com/content/images/synthappbuttons.png" alt="Synth App Buttons in pure CSS">
</div>

[Here is the pen on Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/james2doyle/pen/AKblD "Synth App Buttons"). I usually use jsFidddle but I decided to change it up this time. Maybe my next post will be hosted on tinker.io or dabbletâ€¦ although tinker does not have accounts like the others.

This is the exact same method as my [previous article](http://ohdoylerules.com/web/radio-checkboxes/ "Styling radio and checkbox inputs"), only there is a lot more css.
