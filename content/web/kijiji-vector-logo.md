This logo was not only impossible to find, because searching for "kijiji vector logo" returns nothing but people wanting to sell vector logos **on** Kijiji, but it was difficult to trace as well.

<div class="center">
  <a href="/images/kijiji.svg" title="kijiji svg vector logo" target="_blank"><img alt="kijiji svg vector logo" src="/images/kijiji.svg" ></a>
</div>

The reason I had to find this logo, was that I made a new Chrome app called, "[Kijiji Enhanced](http://goo.gl/8VXrlm "Kijiji Enhanced on the Chrome Web Store")". It allows you to browse with larger thumbnails, rotate images in the image viewer, and also view inline maps at the bottom of posts.
