Here is another logo. This one is for the Kaenon sunglasses brand. This was very hard to find. It doesn't include the little gradient on the original logo. Maybe I will add that in the future.

<div class="center">
  <a href="/images/kaenon.svg" target="_blank"><img alt="kaenon svg vector" src="/images/kaenon.svg" ></a>
</div>

##### Hint

If you are looking for these hard to find logos, sometimes you can find them in a lookbook or catalog PDF. The assets are usually high DPI because most of the time these documents are for printing.
