I created another new field type for [PyroCMS](http://pyrocms.com "PyroCMS Website").

</div>

This one is for doing little "blurb" sections. Essentially I keep seeing little title+image+body components. Like testimonials, user profiles, portfolio snippets. These all follow a title+image+body format. So I built a little field type to provide an easy way to manage these in your page types.

<div class="center">

</div>

I also put the [project on github](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-blurb-field "pyro-blurb field github") so that you can see it. It will also be on the PyroCMS Store.
