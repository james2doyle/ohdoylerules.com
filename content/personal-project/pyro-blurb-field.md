I created another new field type for
[PyroCMS](http://pyrocms.com "PyroCMS Website").

This one is for doing little "blurb" sections. Essentially I keep seeing
little title+image+body components. Like testimonials, user profiles,
portfolio snippets. These all follow a title+image+body format. So I
built a little field type to provide an easy way to manage these in your
page types.

I also put the [project on
github](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-blurb-field "pyro-blurb-field github")
so that you can see it. It will also be on the PyroCMS Store.
