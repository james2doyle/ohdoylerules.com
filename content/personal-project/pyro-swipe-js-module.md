Yep, another module. This one is for the awesome [Swipe.js library](https://github.com/bradbirdsall/Swipe "bradbirdsall/Swipe"). Swipe is amazing because it is touch-capable, lightweight and has no dependencies(no jQuery). This module allows users to create multiple slideshows just by choosing a folder they want to pull the images from.

Then using the modules plugin, they can call it anywhere on a page.

Here is is [on github](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-swipe-module "james2doyle/pyro-swipe-module").

It should also make it to the PyroCMS store.
