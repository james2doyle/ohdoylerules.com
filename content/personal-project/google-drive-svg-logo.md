Recently we needed a bunch of vector logos for a blog post. So again, in typical fashion, I had to craft a vector logo from scratch. Luckily the Google Drive logo is pretty simple. Just 3 shapes. All trapezoids (?).

<div class="center">
  <a href="/images/google-drive.svg" target="_blank" title="google drive svg vector"><img width="300" alt="google drive svg vector" src="/images/google-drive.svg" ></a>
</div>
