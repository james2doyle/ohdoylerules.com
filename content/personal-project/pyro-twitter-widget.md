I created another widget for PyroCMS. This one is for Twitter. I didn't
find one that I liked or thought was very good, so I created my own.
This widget actually uses a 3rd party sub-module, for the Twitter
authentication, called
[twitter-api-php](https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php "J7mbo/twitter-api-php").
Here are the current supported (basically just tested) API endpoints:

-   statuses/mentions\_timeline
-   statuses/user\_timeline
-   statuses/home\_timeline
-   statuses/retweetsofme
-   favorites/list

Here is the [widget on
Github](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-twitter-widget "james2doyle/pyro-twitter-widget").
