A few months back I was interviewed by the developer socila network Koding.

The initiative was for them to showcase some of the people using their network to build their skill and circle of friends. It is a really cool social network that has been gaining a lot of traction lately.

Here is [the link to the interview](http://stories.koding.com/story/james-doyle/).
