I have created a new app (with the help of [Beatrice Law](https://twitter.com/beatricelaw)) called [Reverse Geocode](http://goo.gl/Z15Teh "Reverse Geocode on the Chrome Web Store").

In the process of building the site for [Textbooks For Change](http://textbooksforchange.ca/), a [WARPAINT Media](http://warpaintmedia.ca) client, I realized I needed an easy way for them to reverse geocode an address for their map listings.

The site is built on [PhileCMS](http://philecms.github.io/Phile/) so it is very fast, but requires a little more savvy-ness than normal. I added the static Google Map that is based on the list of coordinates they enter in.

</div>

It is very easy to update, but not quite that easy to get the coordinates. There is a Google tool to do this, but it is actually not as nice (but I have an obvious bias).

The app allows you to enter in an address, then they app goes and gets the latitude and longitude. Then, because this is a [Chrome Packaged App](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html), you can copy it right to your clipboard with a single click!

You can download the app on the [Chrome Web Store](http://goo.gl/Z15Teh "Reverse Geocode on the Chrome Web Store").

The app [is also on github](https://github.com/WARPAINTMedia/chrome-reverse-geocode "Reverse Geocode on Github") so anyone can submit some changes and improvements.
