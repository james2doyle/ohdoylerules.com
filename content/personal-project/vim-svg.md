Here is a beauty. People have been looking for this Vim logo in a vector format for quite some time. There is of course the [old logo](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vimlogo.svg), but it looks pretty strange. It reminds me of Tron for some reason.

Anyway this was a pain to make because of all the layers and custom shaping of the V. Also I had to make a bunch of changes to everything once I tested it in the browser because it was all busted.

I usually test my SVGs in the browser as a final OK point. I know if it renders there, then everything should be fine. Also people want it for using as a retina icon now, since the advent of responsive design and development.

<div class="center">
  <a href="http://ohdoylerules.com/content/images/vim.svg" target="_blank"><img alt="vim svg vector" src="http://ohdoylerules.com/content/images/vim.svg" ></a>
</div>

If you happen to use this for anything, it would be nice to recieve some credit for it. I actually couldn't find who made the original Vim logo. It might just be lost in time.
