Here is a beauty. People have been looking for this Vim logo in a vector format for quite some time. There is of course the [old logo](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vimlogo.svg), but it looks pretty strange. It reminds me of Tron for some reason.

Anyway this was a pain to make because of all the layers and custom shaping of the V. Also I had to make a bunch of changes to everything once I tested it in the browser because it was all busted.

I usually test my SVGs in the browser as a final OK point. I know if it renders there, then everything should be fine. Also people want it for using as a retina icon now, since the advent of responsive design and development.

<div class="center">
  <a href="/images/vim.svg" target="_blank"><img alt="vim svg vector" src="/images/vim.svg" ></a>
</div>

If you happen to use this for anything, it would be nice to recieve some credit for it. I actually couldn't find who made the original Vim logo. It might just be lost in time.

#### Update

I made a icns version for OSX. You can [download it here](/images/vim.icns).

You can change the MacVim icon if you want. I happen to think this one is a little nicer.

#### Update 2

I have found another person who wanted a new vim icon. They added it to the fork of [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/). Here is the [commit from his repo](https://github.com/kaishin/macvim/commit/fedcb4579b68439dba85b9d7fa4b076faac7ebad) with the new icon.
