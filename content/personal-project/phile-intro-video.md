[PhileCMS](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile) now has a [new instructional video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GLMe371RuI).

Here are some of the points I hit on in the video:

* Installation
* Differences To Pico
* About Twig
* Creating Content
* Using Meta Data
* Themes
* Conditional Navigations
* Plugins
* Tricks

The video is about 35 minutes. So there is quite a lot of stuff in there. I plan on making a few more videos. One about making themes and using the [phileGruntThemeing](https://github.com/PhileCMS/phileGruntThemeing) project, and creating plugins with the events system.
