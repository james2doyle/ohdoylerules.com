I created a small image widget for PyroCMS. It allows a user to choose
any image in the files as a widget. It also allows you to add a link and
a target so it can be opened in a new tab. Here is [the github
link](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-image-widget "Pyro Image Widget Github")
and the [PyroCMS store
link](https://www.pyrocms.com/store/details/pyro_image_widget "Pyro Image Widget").
