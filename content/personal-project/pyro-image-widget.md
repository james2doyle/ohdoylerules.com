I created a small image widget for PyroCMS. It allows a user to choose any image in the files as a widget. It also allows you to add a link and a target so it can be opened in a new tab. Here is [the github link](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-image-widget "Pyro Image Widget Github") and the [PyroCMS store link](https://www.pyrocms.com/store/details/pyro_image_widget "Pyro Image Widget").
