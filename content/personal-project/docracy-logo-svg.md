Description: "Docracy logo in vector svg"
---

The other founder of my company ([WARPAINT Media](http://warpaintmedia.ca "WARPAINT Media Homepage")) was working on a blog post where we list all the PAAS/SAAS tools that we use. One of them is [Docracy](https://www.docracy.com/ "Docracy Homepage"). It is a site that shares free legal documents. You can modify and fork them to your own account, they have signing features as well.

Well again, I was unable to find the vector logo of their icon. So in my typical fashion, I recreated it. You can see it below.

<div class="center">
  <a href="/images/docracy.svg" title="docracy svg vector" target="_blank"><img alt="docracy svg vector" src="/images/docracy.svg" ></a>
</div>
