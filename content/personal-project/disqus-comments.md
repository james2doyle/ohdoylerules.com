I have finally added a decent comment system to this site. I installed Disqus. It is pretty awesome. I have used it before and it is a great system. I have enabled comments on *every* post on the site.

I may go back and turn some off but for the most part they are enabled by default. You could be really meta and comment on this post about the new comments! *wink wink!*
