I finally finished the conversion of the [Kube CSS
Framework](http://imperavi.com/kube/). The original is written in
[LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and I have rewrote it to work with
[Styl](https://github.com/visionmedia/styl) and
[Rework](https://github.com/visionmedia/rework). [Here is the github
repo](https://github.com/james2doyle/kube-styl "james2doyle/kube-styl").
