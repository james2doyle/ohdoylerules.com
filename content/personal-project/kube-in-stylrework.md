I finally finished the conversion of the [Kube CSS Framework](http://imperavi.com/kube/).

The original is written in [LESS](http://lesscss.org/ "LESSCSS Homepage") and I have rewrote it to work with [Styl](https://github.com/visionmedia/styl "visionmedia/styl") and [Rework](https://github.com/visionmedia/rework "visionmedia/rework").

[Here is the github repo](https://github.com/james2doyle/kube-styl "james2doyle/kube-styl")
