I created a [bunch of snippets](https://github.com/james2doyle/jquery-plugin-snippets "james2doyle/jquery-plugin-snippets") out of the patterns from [shichuans javascript patterns repo](https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/tree/master/jquer -plugin-patterns "shichuan javascript patterns"). These are for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/ "sublime text site") which everyone knows. You just clone the repo into the packages directory and they magically appear. If you don't use sublime text...

  <img alt="y u no use sublime text 2" src="http://ohdoylerules.com/content/images/tumblr_l96b01l36p1qdhmifo1_50.jpg" >
</div>

I had to create that image because it didn't exists for some reason... [Github Linky](https://github.com/james2doyle/jquery-plugin-snippets "james2doyle/jquery-plugin-snippets").
