I created a [bunch of
snippets](https://github.com/james2doyle/jquery-plugin-snippets "james2doyle/jquery-plugin-snippets")
out of the patterns from [shichuans javascript patterns
repo](https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/tree/master/jquery-plugin-patterns "shichuan javascript patterns").
These are for [Sublime Text
2](http://www.sublimetext.com/ "sublime text site") which everyone
knows. You just clone the repo into the packages directory and they
magically appear. If you don't use sublime text... ![y u no use sublime
text
2](http://ohdoylerules.com/content/images/tumblr_l96b01l36p1qdhmifo1_500.jpg)
I had to create that image because it didn't exists for some reason...
