Lo and behold, a new vector. This one is for the Groupon logo. This is actually based on another logo that was black. It wasn't very nice, so I picked the Groupon greens from their site and applied them to the background gradient. I also removed the gaudy font gradient and left them as flat white.

Below is the source SVG for download.

<div class="center">
