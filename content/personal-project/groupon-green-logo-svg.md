Lo and behold, a new vector. This one is for the Groupon logo. This is actually based on another logo that was black. It wasn't very nice, so I picked the Groupon greens from their site and applied them to the background gradient. I also removed the gaudy font gradient and left them as flat white.

Below is the source SVG for download.

<div class="center">
  <a href="/images/groupon.svg" title="groupon svg vector" target="_blank"><img alt="groupon svg vector" src="/images/groupon.svg" ></a>
</div>
