I wrote a small plugin for the Pico CMS. I recently discovered a very
cool PHP-based CMS called, [Pico
CMS](http://pico.dev7studios.com/ "Pico CMS Homepage"). This CMS is a
no-database flat-file CMS. It is really fast and very easy. There was no
real way to handle images in the base version. So I developed a plugin
that can list images in a folder. I named it pico\_slider but it could
probably be named pico\_image\_list because all it really does is expose
an image array to the front-end variables. [Here it is on
Github](https://github.com/james2doyle/pico_slider "james2doyle/pico_slider").
