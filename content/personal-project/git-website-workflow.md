I recently switched to using Amazon Web Services for my hosting. It is
awesome. Because it(EC2) is just a cloud computer, I can install
anything I want and set up any workflow I desire. I recently found [an
article](http://goo.gl/0L3E6 "A web-focused Git workflow") that was
about a website git workflow. I finally got the flow down, but it was
taking a little too long to start a project. So I decided to [make it
into a
script](https://github.com/james2doyle/git-website-workflow "git-website-workflow bash script").
[alert\_blue] This works with any cloud computer workflow. It doesn't
have to be just Amazon. [/alert\_blue]

With a little help from [some people on
google+](https://plus.google.com/109231487156400680487/posts/WzueZxHuP7b "google plus bash community post")
I finally got it down. Check out the [original
article](http://goo.gl/0L3E6 "A web-focused Git workflow") on how it
works and the philosophy of why.
