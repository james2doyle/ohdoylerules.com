The markdown logo in SVG vector format. I found this was not that easy to find. So I whipped one up of my own.

<div class="center">
  <a href="http://ohdoylerules.com/content/images/markdown.svg" target="_blank" title="Markdown Vector SVG logo"><img alt="Markdown Vector SVG logo" src="http://ohdoylerules.com/content/images/markdown.svg" ></a>
</div>
