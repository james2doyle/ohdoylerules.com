I created a list field type for PyroCMS. It allows users to easily add and manage list content. The source code is up [on github](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-list-field "Pyro List Field") and avaliable on the [PyroCMS store](https://www.pyrocms.com/store/details/list_field_type "PyroCMS Store List Field Type").
