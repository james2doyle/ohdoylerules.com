I created a list field type for PyroCMS. It allows users to easily add
and manage list content. The source code is up [on
github](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-list-field "Pyro List Field")
and avaliable on the [PyroCMS
store](https://www.pyrocms.com/store/details/list_field_type "PyroCMS Store List Field Type").
