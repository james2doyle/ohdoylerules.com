### Clean CSS made it into a Chrome Apps Office hours!!

So my chrome app [Clean CSS](http://james2doyle.github.com/clean-css-chrome-app/ "Clean CSS Chrome App") made it onto one of the Chrome Apps Office Hours.

The Office Hours is a series of videos by Google where developers talk to the community about Google technology, software and programming. The way I got on was I saw Paul Kinlan, a Google Chrome developer advocate, make a post about the live office hours being held that day.

I managed to get a link to my app and he then reviewed it on the show!

The app [is also on github](https://github.com/james2doyle/clean-css-chrome-app/ "Clean CSS on Github") so anyone can submit some changes and improvements.  You can download the app on the [Chrome Web Store](http://goo.gl/D9F7u "Clean CSS on Chrome Web Store")
