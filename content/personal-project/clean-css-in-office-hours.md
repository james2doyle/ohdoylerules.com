### Clean CSS made it into a Chrome Apps Office hours!!

So my chrome app [Clean
CSS](http://james2doyle.github.com/clean-css-chrome-app/ "Clean CSS Chrome App")
made it onto one of the Chrome Apps Office Hours. The Office Hours is a
series of videos by Google where developers talk to the community about
Google technology, software and programming. The way I got on was I saw
Paul Kinlan, a Google Chrome developer advocate, make a post about the
live office hours being held that day. I managed to get a link to my app
and he then reviewed it on the show!

The app [is also on
github](https://github.com/james2doyle/clean-css-chrome-app/ "Clean CSS on Github")
so anyone can submit some changes and improvements.

You can download the app on the [Chrome Web
Store](http://goo.gl/D9F7u "Clean CSS on Chrome Web Store")
