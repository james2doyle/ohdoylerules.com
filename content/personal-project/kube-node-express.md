I have released my first node.js-based public repo! It is called
[Kube-Node-Express](https://github.com/james2doyle/kube-node-express "Kube-Node-Express").

Kube is a CSS framework by Imperavi[/caption] This is based off of the
[Kube CSS Framework by
Imperavi](http://imperavi.com/kube/ "Kube CSS Framework"). It uses the
[express](http://expressjs.com/ "expressjs") framework for node. This
was inspired by a similar project I saw that was [based on the HTML5
Boilerplate](https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate "node-boilerplate").
I will probably end up stealing more ideas from that project too.

#### disclaimer

I did not create any of these frameworks, I just combined them all
together.
