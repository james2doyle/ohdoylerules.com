I have released my first node.js-based public repo! It is called [Kube-Node-Express](https://github.com/james2doyle/kube-node-express "Kube-Node-Express").

This is based off of the [Kube CSS Framework by Imperavi](http://imperavi.com/kube/ "Kube CSS Framework"). It uses the [express](http://expressjs.com/ "expressjs") framework for node. This was inspired by a similar project I saw that was [based on the HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate "node boilerplate"). I will probably end up stealing more ideas from that project too.

#### disclaimer

I did not create any of these frameworks, I just combined them all together.
