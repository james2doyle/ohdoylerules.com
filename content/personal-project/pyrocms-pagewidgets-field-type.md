I created another field type for
[PyroCMS](https://www.pyrocms.com/ "PyroCMS Website"). This one is so
you can add widgets on a page-by-page basis instead of area-by-area. I
kept getting asked by clients for this feature, and with the advent of
the new page type and field types this is a lot easier. The source is on
[github](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-pagewidgets-field "pyro-pagewidgets-field").
