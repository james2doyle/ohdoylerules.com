I created another field type for [PyroCMS](https://www.pyrocms.com/ "PyroCMS Website"). This one is so you can add widgets on a page-by-page basis instead of area-by-area.

I kept getting asked by clients for this feature, and with the advent of the new page type and field types this is a lot easier. The source is on [github](https://github.com/james2doyle/pyro-pagewidgets-field "pyro-pagewidgets-field")
