Photo Shake Demo[/caption]

It uses the HTML5 File Api and also uses the device orientation API.
Firstly, you upload or take a picture, then that picture fades up below
in a polaroid-style div. You can then move you device and see the
picture move.

I also added something I called dynamic shine. This is just a diagonal
white-to-transparent gradient. Tilting the device causes the photo to
look like it is interacting with the light.

You can also see the project [self-hosted
here](http://ohdoylerules.com/test/cameraapi/ "photo shake").

#### UPDATE:

I got runner up! Here are the
[results](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/09/announcing-the-august-dev-derby-winners/ "Mozilla Dev Derby August")
