I have just submitted my demo for the [Mozzila Dev Derby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/photo-shake "Photo Shake Page"). If you like it, please vote. Thank you!

It uses the HTML5 File Api and also uses the device orientation API. Firstly, you upload or take a picture, then that picture fades up below in a polaroid-style div. You can then move you device and see the picture move.

I also added something I called dynamic shine. This is just a diagonal white-to-transparent gradient. Tilting the device causes the photo to look like it is interacting with the light.

You can also see the project [self-hosted here](http://ohdoylerules.com/test/cameraapi/ "photo shake").

#### UPDATE:

I got runner up! Here are the [results](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/09/announcing-the-august-dev-derby-winners/ "Mozilla Dev Derby August")
