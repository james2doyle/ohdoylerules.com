I like [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/ "jsFiddle"). I often use it for prototyping. I might want to see what I can make in css or maybe I want to build a little template. A perfect example, I used it to mockup my [work](http://ohdoylerules.com/work/ "Work") section.

Since it is just a repeating template, I built the classes and styles in jsFiddle and then just dropped in the PHP `echo`s. Anyway, here is something I made. It uses generated content. You can use HTML attributes in CSS. This is a classic example:

```css
/*! styles for printing */
@media print{
  /*! all a tags with an href attribute */
  a[href]:after{
    /*! display that href after the value */
    content: " (" attr(href) ")";
  }
}
```

### What does this look like?

Would render as [Website (www.example.com/)](www.example.com/)

So with that in mind, I thought it would be cool to have a button that would render a count. So in practical applications it might be used for something like an inbox button. In the case I built it is a notifications button.

<div class="center">
  <img src="http://ohdoylerules.com/content/images/54368011.png" alt="notifications button" >
</div>

```html
button {
  color: #333;
  padding: 4px 10px;
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  outline: none;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: 'Corbin';
  background: #eee;
  border-radius: 3px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
  text-shadow: 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.8);
}
button:after {
  content: attr(data-count);
  border-radius: 10px;
  display: inline-block;
  background: #777;
  padding: 2px 5px;
  width: 15px;
  margin: 0 0 0 8px;
  color: white;
  font-weight: normal;
  border: 1px solid #555;
  box-shadow: inset 0 1px 2px rgba(255,255,255,0.5),
      inset 0 -1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
  text-shadow: 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
}â€‹
```
