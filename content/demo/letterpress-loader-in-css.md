I recently bought the amazing Letterpress app for iPhone. It truly is
gorgeous, and has an amazing UI. It inspired me to make this little
doodle.

Letterpress Loader In CSS[/caption]

This is a little tribute. It's an animated css loader in the style of
Letterpress. It's a little different because it uses the custom
cubic-bezier curve called 'ease-in-out-back', which is essentially
elastic. I got the values from the great site
[Ceaser](http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/ "Ceaser"). As always, [check out
