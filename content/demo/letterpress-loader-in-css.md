I recently bought the amazing Letterpress app for iPhone. It truly is gorgeous, and has an amazing UI. It inspired me to make this little doodle.

This is a little tribute. It's an animated css loader in the style of Letterpress. It's a little different because it uses the custom cubic-bezier curve called 'ease-in-out-back', which is essentially elastic. I got the values from the great site [Ceaser](http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/ "Ceaser").
