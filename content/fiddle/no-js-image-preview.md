Using css transforms, I was able to build a little image previewer.
There is only one image for both the thumbnail and full size view. Scale
does wonders.

No-Js Image Preview[/caption]

I created this guy in
[Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/james2doyle/pen/fChbD "Codepen.io"). It
seems to be a lot better than just showing all the html/css/js in a
post. I would appreciate any comments or possible improvements. I might
try to build some sort of template/plugin so that anyone can just plop
in their images and BAM it works nicely.
