Using CSS transforms, I was able to build a little image previewer. There is only one image for both the thumbnail and full size view. Scale does wonders.

<div class="center">
  <img src="/images/No-Js-Image-Preview-CodePen.png" alt="No Js Image Preview Â· CodePen" >
</div>

I created this guy in [Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/james2doyle/pen/fChbD "Codepen.io"). It seems to be a lot better than just showing all the html/css/js in a post. I would appreciate any comments or possible improvements. I might try to build some sort of template/plugin so that anyone can just plop in their images and BAM it works nicely.
