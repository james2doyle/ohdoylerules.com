I crafted [this lil' beauty](http://codepen.io/james2doyle/pen/HpbrL "css3-pagebend") in class today. It turns out that it is really hard to make transforming elements intersect. At least, I couldn't figure it out.

[![css3-pagebend](/images/css3-pagebend11.jpg "css3-pagebend")](http://codepen.io/james2doyle/pen/HpbrL)

I ended up having to essentially split the image in 2 and then rotateY one of the sides. It didn't look quite right when it was bending at the middle, so I made the split like 60-40. As always, click the image for the live action.
