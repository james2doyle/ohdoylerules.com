A few weeks ago, or something like that, I made a post about [styling
your labels to act as
checkboxes/radios](http://ohdoylerules.com/web/radio-checkboxes/ "Styling radio and checkbox inputs").
I recently saw [a post on Dribbble by Mikael
Eidenberg](http://dribbble.com/shots/693245-Untitled-iPhone-synth-app-waveforms "Synth App by Mikael Eidenberg")
which inspired me to make some nicely styled examples of that method in
action.

Synth App Buttons in pure CSS![/caption]

[Here is the pen on
Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/james2doyle/pen/AKblD "Synth App Buttons - Codepen.io").
I usually use jsFidddle but I decided to change it up this time. Maybe
my next post will be hosted on tinker.io or dabblet... although tinker
does not have accounts like the others.

This is the exact same method as my [previous
article](http://ohdoylerules.com/web/radio-checkboxes/ "Styling radio and checkbox inputs"),
only there is a lot more css.
