I am trying to make up for not posting in the last few days. Here is another thing I have been working on. It is a replication of [another dribbble post](http://dribbble.com/shots/713807-Extended "Event Card").

[![css-event-card](http://ohdoylerules.com/content/images/css-event-card2111.jpg "Event card replicated in CSS")](http://dabblet.com/gist/3743024)

There are a couple of things missing but most of them would be replicated with a webfont. There was also the issue of not having a choice in the anti-aliasing of the font. The image was made using photoshop and probably used crisp or smooth which makes the font look *real nice*. I don't even know if I got the font right. I used Open Sans. It looked close enough so whatever. I've been working on this on and off for about 2 weeks so it is time to give it away!

Click the image for a dabblet. *BTW, I always misspell dabblet because of the triple B in dribbble!*
